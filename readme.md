WeToDo is a easy-to-use to-do list and notepad, made with both simplicity and power in mind. Keep track of your goals with a few simple taps.

## Create, Manage, and Complete
Easily create multiple lists, each containing their own unique mix of sortable checks, notes, and dividers.

Organize your thoughts, take notes on presentations, keep track of what you need for your dinner, check off your schools supplies as you buy them, and more!

## Work Together
With collaborative editing, you can decide who is bringing what to a party, make a grocery list for your family, keep track of pieces of a group project, and many others. Whatever you need to manage, WeToDo can help.

More information about collaborative editing is available at the [Vevox Workshop](http://wiki.vevox.io/projects/wetodo/sharing).
